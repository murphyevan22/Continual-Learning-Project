## Experiment1 (Compact 20 tasks into VGG16 network)

**Step 1.** Download CIFAR100 and form the 20 tasks based on their super classes with the [cifar2png](https://github.com/knjcode/cifar2png) tool. Or you can just download the converted version of our CIFAR100 from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eo2RhMmhxzUNOZa0Z7jy7y4lOn3lqddU/view?usp=sharing). Unzip the compressed file and place `cifar100_org/` in `data/`. 

**Step 2.** Use the following command to train individual models for each of the 20 tasks so that we can obtain their accuracy goals. 

```
$ bash experiement1/baseline_cifar100.sh 
```

If you would like to use higher accuracy goals, execute `experiment1/finetune_cifar100.sh` instead. The script randomly selects a model trained on previous tasks and finetunes it to the current one. After this step, we obtain `logs/baseline_cifar100_acc.txt` that contains accuracy goals for 20 tasks. 


**Step 3.** Run CPG to learn 20 tasks sequentially.

```
$ bash experiment1/CPG_cifar100_scratch_mul_1.5.sh
```

If you use another accuracy goals, please modify the `baseline_cifar100_acc` variable in `experiment1/CPG_cifar100_scratch_mul_1.5.sh` to the path containing your accuracy goals. 


**Step 4.** Inference the learned 20 tasks. 

```
$ bash experiment1/inference_CPG_cifar100.sh
```

## Experiment2 (Compact 6 fine-grained image tasks into ResNet50 network)  


**Step 1.** We provide the datasets of 5 tasks, including *cubs_cropped*, *stanford_cars_cropped*, *flowers*, *wikiart* and *sketches* (without *imagenet*), and they can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a-FiCtYO_7nRcI9eIHrlZysq_0N3Sh2P/view?usp=sharing). After downloading, place the extracted directories in `data/`. If you would like to construct datasets yourself, please refer to [piggyback](https://github.com/arunmallya/piggyback). 


**Step 2.** Similar to Experiment1, we need to construct the accuracy goals for the 6 tasks. With the following command, we finetune the model pretrained on ImageNet to the other 5 tasks and produce accuracy goals stored in `logs/baseline_imagenet_acc_resnet50.txt`. 

```
$ bash experiment2/baseline_imagenet.sh
```

Or we can simply use the results of individual ResNet50 networks reported in the [piggyback paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06519.pdf) as follows. 

```
{"imagenet": "0.7616", "cubs_cropped": "0.8283", "stanford_cars_cropped": "0.9183", "flowers": "0.9656", "wikiart": "0.7560", "sketches": "0.8078"}
```

**Step 3.** Run CPG and choose the desired pruning ratio for each of the 6 tasks.

```
$ bash experiment2/CPG_imagenet.sh 
```

We use the above command to run CPG for the task specified by the `TARGET_TASK_ID` varaiable in `experiment2/CPG_imagenet.sh`. 

For example, start from *imagenet* (specified by `TARGET_TASK_ID=1`), we run the above command and then select the gradually pruned model to proceed to learn the next task. 

More specifically, we check the `record.txt` in the checkpoint path, like `checkpoints/CPG/experiment2/resnet50/imagenet/gradual_prune/record.txt`, and find that there are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... , 0.95 pruning ratios with their corresponding accuracies. We select the appropriate pruning ratio whose accuracy is higher than (or at least close to) the *imagenet*'s accuracy goal. Supposed that 0.4 is the best pruning ratio, we copy the corresponding checkpoint to `gradual_prune/` as below. 

```
In checkpoint/CPG/resnet50/imagenet/gradual_prune/

$ cp 0.4/checkpoint-46.pth.tar ./checkpoint-46.pth.tar

```

At last, we modify `TARGET_TASK_ID` to 2 and execute `experiment2/CPG_imagenet.sh` again so that CPG proceeds to learn the next task. 

We repeat **Step 3.** to sequentially learn the 6 tasks. 


**Step 4.** Inference the learned 6 tasks. 

```
$ bash experiment2/inference_CPG_imagenet.sh
```

## Experiment3 (Compact 4 facial-informatic tasks into CNN20 network)

**Step 1.** We provide the datasets of 3 tasks, including *emotion*, *gender* and *age* (without *face_verification*). For the *age* task, we adopt the 5-fold scenario and thus have *age0*, *age1*, ... , *age4* which correspond to the five splits. All face images are aligned using [MTCNN](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1604/1604.02878.pdf) with output size of 112 x 112. The converted datasets can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F2jx7k15EWA1P64Bp462ovB4zHb50tz_/view?usp=sharing). 


**Step 2.** Similarly, we need accuracy goals of the 4 tasks for CPG. We train CNN20 on VGGFace2 for the *face verification* task and finetune it to *emotion*, *gender* and *age* tasks. This [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P3KiJGdanBbTpSFeLtbQCXIyoYrW8LtN/view?usp=sharing) provides our *face verification* CNN20 pretrained weights (named `face_weight.pth`), and the following command finetunes the model to other 3 tasks. To evaluate the *face verification* task, we also need `lfw_pairs.txt` which can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wuKxHrDXebWicDxqt6FpBMhMbdN6wEDf/view?usp=sharing). Download `face_weight.pth` and `lfw_pairs.txt` use the links and place them in `face_data/`.

```
$ bash experiment3/baseline_face.sh 
```

The finetuning results are used as accuracy goals and stored in `logs/baseline_face_acc.txt`. You can also simply use the results as follows which corresponds to the finetuning results reported in our paper. 

```
{"face_verification": "0.9942", "gender": "0.9080", "emotion": "0.6254", "chalearn_gender": "0.9128", "age0": "0.6531", "age1": "0.5381", "age2": "0.5847", "age3": "0.5151", "age4": "0.5727"}
```

**Step 3.** Similar to Experiment2, we add tasks sequentially by iteratively running the following command and copy the pruned models with appropriate pruning ratios. 

```
$ bash experiment3/FvGeEm_CPG_face.sh 
```

Note that this script is only for learning the first 3 tasks, *face verification*, *gender* and *emotion*, by modifiying the `TARGET_TASK_ID` variable in it. Because we have 5 folds for the *age* task, use `experiment3/FvGeEmAg0_CPG_face.sh` for *age0*, `experiment3/FvGeEmAg1_CPG_face.sh` for *age1*, and so on. 

We repeat **Step 3.** until all 4 tasks, including 5 folds of the age task, are sequentially learned. 


**Step 4.** Inference the learned 4 tasks. 

```
$ bash experiment3/inference_FvGeEmAg.sh ${GPU_ID} ${TARGET_SPARSITY} ${AGEFOLD} ${LOG_PATH}
```

The inference script takes 4 arguments listed as follows: 
* GPU_ID: Index of GPU used to run the inference
* TARGET_SPARSITY: The target pruning ratio of the age task model to inference (like 0,1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, 0.95)
* AGEFOLD: The target fold of the 5 age folds to inference (like age0, age1, ..., age4)
* LOG_PATH: The target path to output inference log

For an example of using this script, please see `experiment3/inference_checkpoints_FvGeEmAg.sh`.
